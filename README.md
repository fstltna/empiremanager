Includes these tools:

- **WolfpackEmpireCreator** - Allows you to create &amp; keep settings for the "fairland" Wolfpack Empire script. Lets you keep a record of the worlds you created to recreate a world with the same settings.

- **empiremanager** - For use in a BBS or as a shell login command. Lets you see what countries are available for use, and displays help files.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- cpan -i UI::Dialog
- cpan -i Term::ReadKey
- cpan -i Term::ANSIScreen
- cpan -i Proc::ProcessTable
- cpan -i Number::Bytes::Human

I then suggest you read the README.md files in each of the subfolders to be sure you have it set up correctly.
