# Directory where this game's data is stored
data "/sbbs/doors/empire/var/empire"

# Directory where info pages are stored, can be shared among games
info "/sbbs/doors/empire/share/empire/info.nr"
# Set this to your build tree's info.nr to run the server without
# installing it.

# Directory where builtin files are stored
builtin "/sbbs/doors/empire/share/empire/builtin"
# Set this to your source tree's src/lib/global to run the server
# without installing it, else leave it alone.

# Local IP address the server should listen on
listen_addr ""
# "" listens on all, localhost just on the loopback interface.
# OpenBSD restriction: when the system has both IPv4 and IPv6
# addresses configured, "" listens on all IPv4 addresses, and "::"
# on all IPv6 addresses.  There is no way to listen both on all IPv4
# and on all IPv6 interfaces.
# Systems using GNU libc such as Linux are frequently configured in a
# way that makes listen_addr  listen only on all IPv4 addresses.
# You need to use "::" to listen on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
